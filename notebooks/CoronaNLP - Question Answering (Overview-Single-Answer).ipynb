Concerning these results, rFeIFNω seems to be able to contribute to the management of this reality by improving clinical signs and decreasing concurrent viral excretion. This rapid compounding could overwhelm response capacity and would have resulted in compromised effectiveness of containment measures. A coordinated response to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires an approach that balances an infection control mandate with the need to preserve access to essential health services. Our method effectively addresses the problem of infectious disease prevention, greatly reducing labor and time costs. As the early response may be crucial in containing the problem and minimizing resultant morbidity and mortality, efforts have been made to develop biosurveillance systems to detect outbreaks and attacks. Coordination of such activities would promote routine inter-state assistance as well as collaboration during emergencies. To control the transmission of the disease, surveillance systems with high sensitivity and specificity need to be created. Finally, antibodies give immediate protection, important during rapidly evolving epidemics or pandemics and for individuals being deployed into zones of high transmission. In the multivariate analysis, we explored the likelihood of an invasive procedure based on several predictors including the presenting symptoms, age and respiratory viral diagnosis. Plasma or serum samples were tested for serologic evidence of acute DENV infection by immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays, or both (14). The IgG capture ELISA (E-DEN02G, Panbio, Windsor, Australia) was used to classify the cases into primary or secondary DENV infection. The diagnostic decision limit or cut-off represents a serological assay test value used to dichotomize negative and positive results, and by inference, to define the infection status of an individual against a specific pathogen of disease. Multiple biologic and clinical markers consistent with disrupted airway homeostasis should be considered when developing algorithms to define thresholds of infection. The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses.</div></span>"
